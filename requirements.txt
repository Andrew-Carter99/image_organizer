# Core functionality requires only Python standard library:
# - os
# - shutil
# - string
# - pathlib
# - datetime
# - hashlib
# - collections

# Optional dependency for enhanced date extraction from photo EXIF data:
# Pillow>=9.0.0

# To install optional dependency:
# pip install Pillow

# Without Pillow, the script will still work but will use file creation dates
# instead of EXIF "date taken" metadata for date-based renaming.
