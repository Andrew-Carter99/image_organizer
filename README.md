# Desktop Image Organizer

A Python script to locate and organize image files scattered across multiple hard drives on Windows.

## Features

- üîç **Multi-Drive Scanning**: Automatically detects and scans all available drives on your system
- üìÅ **Organized Structure**: Creates drive-specific subfolders to track where images came from
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Operation**: 
  - Dry run mode to preview changes before moving files
  - Skips system directories to avoid breaking Windows
  - Handles filename conflicts by adding timestamps
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
- üìä **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates and detailed summary statistics
- üìù **Logging**: Saves a detailed log file of all operations

## Supported Image Formats

`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`, `.tif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.ico`, `.heic`, `.raw`, `.cr2`, `.nef`, `.orf`, `.sr2`

## Installation

No external dependencies needed! This script uses only Python standard library.

```bash
# Just make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed
python --version
```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Choose whether to run a dry run first (recommended!)
   - Confirm to proceed with the actual file move

3. **Find your organized images:**
   - Location: `Desktop/Photos to Clean/`
   - Structure:
     ```
     Photos to Clean/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Images from Drive C/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.jpg
     ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.png
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Images from Drive D/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ photo.jpg
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ organize_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt
     ```

## Safety Features

### Directories Automatically Skipped
- Windows system folders (Windows, Program Files, etc.)
- Hidden system folders ($Recycle.Bin, System Volume Information)
- AppData folders
- The destination folder itself

### File Conflict Handling
If a file with the same name already exists in the destination, the script automatically adds a timestamp to the filename.

Example: `photo.jpg` ‚Üí `photo_20251001_143025.jpg`

## Example Output

```

## Customization

You can modify the script to:

- **Change destination folder name**: Edit the `DesktopImageOrganizer()` initialization
  ```python
  organizer = DesktopImageOrganizer("My Custom Folder Name")
  ```

- **Add/remove image extensions**: Modify the `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` set in the class

- **Scan specific drives only**: Pass a list of drives
  ```python
  organizer.organize_images(drives=['C:\\', 'D:\\'])
  ```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This script MOVES files (not copies them). They will be removed from their original locations.

üí° **Tip**: Always run the dry run mode first to see what will happen before actually moving files.

üîí **Permissions**: You may need administrator privileges to access some directories.

## Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied" errors**: Some folders require administrator access. The script will skip these and continue.

**Script runs slowly**: Large drives with many files will take time to scan. Progress updates will keep you informed.

**Files not found**: Make sure the files haven't been moved already or aren't in excluded system directories.
